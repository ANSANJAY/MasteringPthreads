## Introduction 👋
This document discusses how virtual memory changes in a process when a new thread is created. We also look at stack memory allocation and changes in the page table upon thread creation.

---

## Virtual Memory in Process P 🧠
- **Heap Memory**: Dynamic memory allocation
- **Initialized and Uninitialized Data Segment**: Variables storage
- **Code Segment**: Executable code
- **Stack Memory**: Used for procedure call and return

---

## Changes in Virtual Memory Upon Thread Creation 🛠
- **Same Virtual Memory Space**: No separate virtual memory for the newly created thread.
- **Shared Memory**: All threads share the same virtual address space of a process.
- **New Stack Memory**: Allocated for the new thread for its independent execution.
  
> 📝 **Note**: The thread has equal access to the entire virtual memory of the process, except for its own stack memory, which is private to the thread.

---

## Stack Memory Allocation 📚
- **Original Stack Memory**: Preserved for the parent process.
- **New Stack Memory**: Exclusively for the new thread.
- **Heap Memory Modification**: A thread can modify heap memory, which will be visible to other threads or parent processes.

---

## Creating Multiple Threads 👥
- **Additional Stack Memory**: For each new thread (`T1`, `T2`, `T3` etc.), new stack memory is allocated from the process's virtual memory.
- **Private Stack Memory**: Each thread has its own stack memory, inaccessible by other threads.

---

> 📝 **Note**: Each thread's stack memory is separate and cannot be accessed by other threads. All other segments of the virtual address space are shared among the threads.

## What is Virtual Memory? 🤔

### Question
Could you explain what virtual memory is in the context of a process?

### Answer
Virtual memory is a memory management feature that allows an operating system to use hard disk space as an extension to the RAM. In the context of a process, virtual memory is divided into various segments such as heap memory, initialized and uninitialized data segments, code segments, and stack memory.

---

## How is Virtual Memory Shared in Multithreading? 🧵

### Question
How is virtual memory shared among multiple threads within the same process?

### Answer
In a multithreaded environment within the same process, all threads share the same virtual memory space. This means that the heap memory, initialized and uninitialized data segments, and code segments are common among all threads. Each thread, however, has its own stack memory for independent execution.

---

## What Happens to the Virtual Memory When a Thread is Created? 🛠

### Question
What changes occur in the virtual memory of a process when a new thread is created?

### Answer
When a new thread is created within a process, the overall virtual memory of the process remains unchanged except for the allocation of a new stack memory for the newly created thread. This stack memory is essential for the independent execution of the new thread and is not accessible by other threads.

---

## Explain the Role of Stack Memory in Thread Creation 📚

### Question
What is the role of stack memory when a new thread is created in a process?

### Answer
Stack memory plays a crucial role in thread creation. Each thread needs its own stack memory for independent execution. This stack memory is used for storing local variables and for managing procedure calls and returns. It is allocated from the virtual memory of the process and is private to the respective thread.

---

## How Can Multiple Threads be Managed in Virtual Memory? 👥

### Question
How is virtual memory managed when multiple threads are created in the same process?

### Answer
When multiple threads are created within the same process, additional stack memory is allocated for each new thread (`T1`, `T2`, `T3`, etc.). These stack memories are separate and private to each corresponding thread. The rest of the virtual memory (heap, data segments, code segments) remains shared among all threads.
