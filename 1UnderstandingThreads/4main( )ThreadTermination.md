## Main Thread vs Child Threads 🆚

### Question:
- Are there any differences in privileges between the main thread and child threads in a process?

### Answer:
- Yes, the main thread enjoys extra privileges over child threads. If the main thread terminates, all child threads will be terminated by default. However, the vice versa is not true; child threads terminating does not affect the main thread or other child threads.

## Impact of Main Thread Termination 💥

### Question:
- What happens to child threads if the main thread terminates?

### Answer:
- By default, if the main thread dies, all child threads will also be terminated. This is why developers often use mechanisms like `pause()` to keep the main thread alive, allowing child threads to complete their execution.

## Using `pthread_exit` in Main Thread 🚪

### Question:
- Can you keep child threads running even if the main thread terminates?

### Answer:
- Yes, you can keep child threads running even if the main thread terminates by using the `pthread_exit` API. When you use `pthread_exit` in the main thread, it terminates only the main thread, allowing child threads to continue execution.

```c
pthread_exit(NULL);
```

```C
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void *childThreadFunc(void *arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Child thread working...\n");
        sleep(1);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t childThread;
    pthread_create(&childThread, NULL, childThreadFunc, NULL);

    printf("Main thread finishing...\n");
    pthread_exit(NULL);  // This will exit the main thread but allow the child thread to continue.
    
    // The following line will not be executed.
    printf("This line will not be printed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
```bash
[anamika@fedora missimissi]$ ./child 
Main thread finishing...
Child thread working...
Child thread working...
Child thread working...
Child thread working...
Child thread working...

```

## Impact of Child Thread Termination 👶

### Question:
- What is the impact on other threads if a child thread terminates?

### Answer:
- If a child thread terminates, it has no impact on the main thread or other child threads. A child thread can be terminated through cancellation, `pthread_exit`, or by running to completion, and it only affects that particular child thread.
