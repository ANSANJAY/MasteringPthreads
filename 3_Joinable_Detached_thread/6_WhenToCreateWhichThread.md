# Detailed Revision Notes on Joinable and Detached Threads 📝💻

## Overview 📌

This section discusses the considerations for deciding whether to create a thread as a joinable thread or a detached thread. This decision is crucial in different scenarios, including when implementing MapReduce, waiting for user input, or dealing with network packets.

---

## Key Concepts 📚

- **Joinable Thread**: A thread that returns some result or whose termination needs to be observed by other threads.
- **Detached Thread**: A thread that runs independently, does not return a result, and whose termination is inconsequential.

---

## When to Use Joinable Threads 🤝

### Definition 🤔
- Opt for a joinable thread if it needs to return some result to other threads.
- Useful when another thread needs to be notified of this thread's termination.

### Use Case Examples 🎨
1. **MapReduce Implementation**: In a MapReduce model, the reducer (moderator) thread waits for worker threads to complete their tasks and return results.
2. **Notification of Termination**: Threads that need to notify other threads when they terminate should be joinable.

### Summary 📝
- Use joinable threads when you have threads that are interdependent or need to synchronize their operations.

## When to Use Detached Threads 🏃‍♀️

### Definition 🤔
- Create a thread as detached if it does not need to return any result.
- Use when no other threads care about its termination.

### Use Case Examples 🎨
1. **Infinite Loops**: Threads that run in an infinite loop, like those waiting for user input or network packets.
2. **TCP Servers**: Threads dealing with TCP clients can be either joinable or detached based on requirements.

#### Special Case: Infinite Loop Threads 🔄
- Threads waiting for user input or network packets generally run in an infinite loop.
- Such threads are ideal candidates for being detached threads.

### Summary 📝
- Use detached threads for independent operations that do not affect other threads or don't require synchronization.

## Key Takeaways 🎓

- **Joinable Threads** are used when you need thread synchronization or result aggregation.
- **Detached Threads** are useful for independent and isolated operations.
- Infinite loop threads should typically be detached threads.

Your choice between joinable and detached threads should be guided by the problem statement and the type of interaction you expect between threads.
