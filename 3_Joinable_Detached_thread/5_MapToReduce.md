# Detailed Revision Notes for MapReduce and Thread Management in Multithreading 📝💻

## Overview 📌

The discussion revolves around the concept of MapReduce, an approach that exemplifies the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It explains how to use joinable and detached threads to implement a MapReduce programming model.

---

## Key Terms 📚

- **MapReduce**: A programming model based on the divide-and-conquer strategy.
- **Moderator Thread**: The thread responsible for dividing work into smaller parts and delegating them to worker threads.
- **Worker Threads**: Threads assigned specific work by the moderator thread.
- **Mapper Threads**: Worker threads in the context of MapReduce.
- **Reducer Thread**: A thread that waits for all worker threads to complete their tasks and aggregates the results.

## MapReduce Programming Model 🗺️

### Explanation 🤔
- MapReduce aims to count the number of words in a large text file using a divide-and-conquer approach.
- Main Thread (also known as the **Moderator Thread**) splits the larger task into smaller tasks and assigns them to worker threads.

### Example Scenario 🎨
- A text file with 1200 lines.
- Moderator Thread (`P`) divides this file into ranges of lines.
- Each worker thread (`W1, W2, ...`) is assigned a specific range.

#### Line Assignment 📋
- `W1`: Counts lines 0 to 399.
- `W2`: Counts lines 400 to 799.
- `W3`: Counts lines 800 to 1199.

### Task Distribution and Execution 🔄
1. **Moderator Thread** divides the work.
2. **Worker Threads** (`W1, W2, ...`) are assigned specific ranges.
3. Each worker thread counts the words in its assigned range.

## Roles in MapReduce 🎭

### Mapper Threads 🧑‍🔧
- Worker threads in MapReduce context.
- Work on **non-shared, non-overlapping data**.
- Each worker thread (mapper) has a unique, non-overlapping task.

### Reducer Thread 🧑‍🔬
- Waits for all mapper threads to complete their tasks.
- Aggregates the results to produce the final output.
- **Note**: The moderator thread can also act as the reducer thread, but it's not a requirement.

## Workflow 🌊

1. **Moderator Thread** starts the process.
2. Splits the work and assigns it to **Worker Threads**.
3. **Moderator Thread** then waits for all **Worker Threads** to complete (acts as the **Reducer Thread**).
4. **Worker Threads** complete their tasks and join the **Reducer Thread**, passing along their results (`X`, `Y`, `Z` etc.).
5. **Reducer Thread** sums up all the results to get the final count of words (`X + Y + Z`).

## Key Takeaways 🎓

- **MapReduce** is a divide-and-conquer strategy.
- **Moderator and Reducer Threads** may or may not be the same.
- **Mapper Threads** are the worker threads assigned non-overlapping tasks.
- **Reducer Thread** can't proceed until all mapper threads have returned their results.
