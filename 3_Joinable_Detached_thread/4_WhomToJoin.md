# Detailed Revision Notes for Multithreading and Joinable Threads 📝🔒

## Overview 📌

The focus of this discussion is on understanding how joinable threads work in a multithreading environment, specifically:

- Which threads a child joinable thread can join upon termination.
- An example illustrating the concept.

---

## Key Terms 📚
- **Child Joinable Thread**: A thread that can be joined by other threads waiting for its termination.
- **Parent Thread**: The thread that originally spawned the child thread.
- **Grandchild Thread**: A thread spawned by a child thread.
- **Fork Point (F)**: The point at which a new thread is created.
- **Join Point (J)**: The point at which a thread is waiting for another to complete.

## Can Any Thread Join a Child Thread Upon Termination? 🤔
- It's **not** limited to just the parent thread.
- **Any thread** can join a child joinable thread on termination if they are blocked on the `pthread_join` API.

---

## Example to Illustrate the Concept 🎨

### Setup 🛠
- A **Parent Thread** (`P`) creates a **Child Joinable Thread** (`C`).
  - The fork point is represented as `F`.
- The Child Thread (`C`) further creates another thread called the **Grandchild Thread** (`G`).

### Execution Flow 🔄
1. **Parent Thread** continues execution beyond the fork point `F`.
2. **Child Thread** also moves beyond the fork point `F`.
3. **Grandchild Thread** does the same.

### Waiting Mechanism 🕒
- **Grandchild Thread** invokes `pthread_join` on the handle of the **Child Thread**.
  - The handle is essentially a data structure used in the code.
- **Parent Thread** also invokes `pthread_join` on the handle of the **Child Thread**.
- Now, both the parent and grandchild threads are waiting at their respective join points (`J1` and `J2`) for the child thread to terminate.

### Termination and Join 🛑🔗
- Once the **Child Thread** terminates:
  1. Signals are sent to both **Parent Thread** and **Grandchild Thread**.
  2. These threads resume their execution beyond their join points.

---

## Key Takeaways 🎓
- **Any thread** can invoke `pthread_join` for any other joinable thread.
  - "Here in the system" means within the same process.
- **No Restrictions**: Any thread can wait for any other thread to complete.
- **Only Joinable Threads**: Threads should only wait for the termination of joinable threads and not detached threads. Detached threads never join any other thread.

---

By understanding these concepts, you'll have a clearer idea of how threads can interact with each other in a multithreaded program, particularly when it comes to joinable threads.
