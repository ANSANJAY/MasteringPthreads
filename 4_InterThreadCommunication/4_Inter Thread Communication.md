# Detailed Notes on Inter-Thread Communication 🧵💬

## Introduction 🌟

Welcome back to the course! In this section, we focus on **Inter-thread Communication**, an essential concept for understanding how threads in the same process interact with each other.

## Why Inter-Thread Communication? 🤔

- 📦 Often in a large, complex system built as multi-threaded software, threads may need to **exchange data** with one another.
  
- 🛠 For example, a big software system could be modularized into independent modules like `M1`, `M2`, and `M3`. 
   
- 🔄 These modules are actually independent threads of the same process, say `P`. They may need to communicate. For instance, `M1` might need to send data to `M2`, and `M2` to `M3`, etc.

## Traditional IPC Techniques 📡

- 🌐 When we think of Inter-Process Communication (IPC), several methods come to mind, like **sockets**, **message queues**, **pipes**, and **shared memory**. 
  
- 🛑 **Note**: Technically, these IPC methods could also be used for inter-thread communication. However, they are not the recommended way for threads to interact.

## Recommended Technique: Callbacks or Function Pointers 🚀

- 🤓 The preferred method for communication between threads is through **callbacks** or **function pointers**.
  
- 🌟 **Why?** Because this method is *fast* and doesn't actually involve the transfer of data but rather a transfer of computation.

### Advantages of Callbacks 🌈

1. **Speed**: Communication through callbacks is typically faster.

2. **User Space**: No special attention from the kernel or operating system is required. 

3. **No OS Resources**: This form of communication is completely supported in user space, meaning no OS-level resources need to be explicitly created.

4. **Function Invocation**: Essentially, a callback or function pointer is just the invocation of a function, which happens completely in user space without requiring any OS-level support.
